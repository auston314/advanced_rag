ABSTRACT: Water molecules have been reported to cause the degradation of perovskite crystals by forming a hydrated intermediate structure and then lead iodide irreversibly. Here, the quality of fully crystallized perovskite /uniFB01 lms is found to be improved by spraying water vapor with an appropriate time. Moreover, this healing e /uniFB00 ect was found to be reversible and would disappear when the water molecules escaped. Through measuring the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence of perovskite /uniFB01 lm before and after water vapor spray, we found that water molecules can deactivate the nonradiative recombination centers due to hydrogen bonding with uncoordinated ions on the surface of perovskite /uniFB01 lm. Furthermore, by analyzing the capacitance of devices without and with water vapor spray, the healing or deactivation e /uniFB00 ect was clearly seen in the signi /uniFB01 cantly decreased density of defect states. This work emphasized the e /uniFB00 ectiveness of hydroxyl to heal the defects due to dangling bonds on the material surface, and

close attention should be paid on searching for more stable healing agent with hydroxyl to increase the e /uniFB03 ciency of perovskite solar cells.

M etal -halide perovskite solar cells have attracted intensive research attention in the past few years due to their solution-based process, low cost, and high power conversion e /uniFB03 ciency. 1 -13 A high-quality perovskite thin /uniFB01 lm, containing the properties of high coverage, large grain size, consistent crystal orientation, and low defect concentration, is crucial for a solar cell. 14 -17 It has been reported that moisture can lead to the /uniFB01 lm ' s degradation and eventually the formation of PbI 2 due to the loss of CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI), which becomes a serious problem toward commercial-standard stability. Therefore, perovskite /uniFB01 lms were usually prepared in inert atmosphere (nitrogen, etc.) to resist water molecules. On the other hand, moisture-assisted grain growth or using water as an additive in perovskite precursor has been reported by some groups, and higher quality perovskite /uniFB01 lms that may be correlated with the reconstruction or recrystallization process during /uniFB01 lm formation were obtained. 14,18,19 Note that these approaches were applied for the crystallization formation process of perovskite /uniFB01 lms, which are di /uniFB00 erent from post-treatment to the fully crystallized /uniFB01 lms discussed further below.

The fully crystallized perovskite /uniFB01 lms are generally kept in an inert atmosphere to avoid the hydrolysis by water molecules in ambient air, whereas Snaith et al. reported that the fully crystallized perovskite /uniFB01 lms can be improved by a postmoisture treatment, testi /uniFB01 ed by device performance and steady and timeresolved photoluminescence (PL) tests. 18 The phenomenon was attributed to the fact that water molecules suppress the nonradiative recombination irreversibly by removing excess

MAI in perovskite crystals. Nevertheless, the mechanism of how water molecules a /uniFB00 ect the perovskite /uniFB01 lm and its related photovoltaic performance remains largely unexplored.

In this article, we demonstrate that the quality of perovskite /uniFB01 lms and the device performance can be well improved by spraying water vapor onto the as-prepared /uniFB01 lm. Moreover, this healing e /uniFB00 ect is found to be reversible if water molecules are removed from perovskite /uniFB01 lm. A comprehensive investigation on the phase of the perovskite crystal, charge carrier lifetime, recombination time constant, and density of defect states was conducted in order to have a deep understanding on the e /uniFB00 ect of water molecules on perovskite /uniFB01 lm. These results indicate that water molecules can heal the defect states in perovskite /uniFB01 lms. Further, we explore the mechanism behind this healing e /uniFB00 ect and conclude that a deactivation process of deep-level defects may be the main reason, which originates from the hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups in water molecules and iodide ions in perovskite crystals. This study opens up opportunities for further research of molecular modi /uniFB01 cation with hydroxyl on perovskite /uniFB01 lms to achieve higher quality /uniFB01 lm and better device photovoltaic performance.

The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite /uniFB01 lms were prepared in a nitrogen/uniFB01 lled atmosphere. The as-made /uniFB01 lm without any post-treatment is noted as ' control sample ' (Figure 1a). The

sample that experienced a water vapor spray for 20 s is noted as ' sprayed sample ' (Figure 1b). The sample that experienced a spraying process and a subsequent drying process by vacuum pumping (let water escape) is noted as ' sprayed/dried sample ' (Figure 1c). The vapor spraying time is optimized to be 20 s, as shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. The solar cell devices apply the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 / MAPbI 3 /spiro-MeOTAD/Au con /uniFB01 guration. In I -V characteristics, the sprayed sample shows bigger open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and short-circuit current ( J sc ) compared to the control one (Figure 2a), with an improvement in power conversion e /uniFB03 ciency (PCE) from 12.6% to 14.7%. Then steady-state output measurements are carried out at the maximum output point ( V = 0.7 V) in a nitrogen/uniFB01 lled glovebox under AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm -2 )(Figure 2b). The control sample shows 10.2% steady-state e /uniFB03 ciency, while the e /uniFB03 ciency of sprayed sample increases to 12%. To determine whether this enhancing e /uniFB00 ect can persist after water molecules evaporate from the perovskite crystals, the sprayed/dried sample is also tested. Here vacuum pumping is used in order to accelerate the evaporation process and avoid the unpredictable side e /uniFB00 ects induced by heat treatment. 20 The results show that the performance of sprayed/dried sample is similar to the control sample and inferior to the sprayed sample in both I -V scan and steady-state measurement (Figure 2a and 2b), which means that the healing e /uniFB00 ect of water molecules to perovskite /uniFB01 lm disappears if water evaporates away. On the basis of these results, we can say that vapor spray treatment can improve the performance of perovskite solar cell reversibly.

We speculate some of the possible in /uniFB02 uences of water molecules on perovskite /uniFB01 lms here: changing the phase of perovskite crystals and the /uniFB01 lm morphology or removing excess MAI due to the greater mobility in the presence of water molecules. 18 First, in the work by Yang et al., 21 it was mentioned that a hydrated compound of MA 4 PbI 6 · 2H 2 O was found when a small amount of water (60 /uni03BC L) was added into perovskite powder (200 mg) while there was a small amount residual CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 without any PbI 2 present. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 3a and 3b) and X-ray di /uniFB00 raction (XRD) spectra (Figure 3d) show no di /uniFB00 erence in morphology and composition between sprayed sample (optimum condition, 20 s) and control sample. Further elongating the spraying time to 30 and 60 s will degenerate the /uniFB01 lm into lead iodide (PbI 2 ), as shown in Figure 3c and 3d. This result is di /uniFB00 erent from the work by Yang et al., 21 which may be attributed to di /uniFB00 erent preparation method. Thus, we con /uniFB01 rm that water molecules do not in /uniFB02 uence the phase and

morphology of perovskite /uniFB01 lms within the optimum spraying time.

In order to investigate how water molecules impact the quality of perovskite /uniFB01 lms and the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices, we carry out various measurements on the samples. The Urbach energy (Eu) was used to characterize the defect states within the band gap of perovskite /uniFB01 lm. Urbach energy can be expressed by A ( E ) ≈ e E/Eu , where A is the absorbance and E is the excitation energy. 22,23 The linear /uniFB01 tto the Urbach tail gives a Urbach energy of ∼ 35 meV for control sample, ∼ 26 meV for sample sprayed for 20 s, and ∼ 38 meV for sample sprayed for 60 s (Figure 2c). These results indicate a signi /uniFB01 cant in /uniFB02 uence of water molecules on the quality of perovskite crystals: 20 s spraying gives a better /uniFB01 lm quality than control and 60 s sprayed samples.

PL mapping was conducted to further investigate the role of water molecules on perovskite /uniFB01 lm. Figure 4a and 4b shows the PL mapping in a /uniFB01 xed region of about 9 × 9 /uni03BC m 2 on a perovskite /uniFB01 lm before and after vapor sprayed for 20 s. The enhanced PL intensity in almost the entire region indicates that water molecules improve the quality of overall perovskite /uniFB01 lm. Figure 4c depicts the optical image of the tested region. The steady-state PL measurement (Figure 4d) shows a tremendous increase in PL intensity for the sample sprayed for 20 s and an obvious blue shift of about 12.5 nm compared to control sample. These results imply a suppressing e /uniFB00 ect of the nonradiative recombination in perovskite crystals induced by water molecules.

In order to con /uniFB01 rm our hypothesis, we performed the timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) test using the timecorrelated single-photon counting method. The charge carrier lifetime in the perovskite is strongly dependent on the polycrystalline nature of the /uniFB01 lm and the defect density or electronic trap density within the /uniFB01 lms. 22 The perovskite /uniFB01 lm showed a longer minority carrier lifetime after vapor spray (Figure 5a). However, its lifetime decreased to the initial value after vacuum drying treatment, which can extract the water molecules away from the /uniFB01 lms. This was more evidence for the reversible deactivation e /uniFB00 ect of the water molecules to the deep-level defects in perovskite /uniFB01 lms. Considering the volatility of water molecules under regular ambient, we carried out the TRPL tests for the sample before and after vapor spray treatment with time to /uniFB01 gure out the dynamic in /uniFB02 uence of the water molecules (Figure 5b). For the sample kept for 10 min after vapor spraying, the charge carrier lifetime increased from 150 to 240 ns compared to the result before vapor spray. Furthermore, the lifetime decreased to 176 ns when the sample

(c) Absorption spectra of control sample and sprayed sample for vapor spray of 20 and 60 s. The linear /uniFB01 t (dotted line) of the Urbach tail is used to obtain the Urbach energy (Eu).

was kept for another 10 min. Referring to our hypothesis, the increment of carrier lifetime of the sample kept for 10 min after spraying is due to the healing e /uniFB00 ect of water molecules which suppress the nonradiative recombination process. However, with time elongated, MAI would escape from the perovskite crystals with water molecules during evaporation. This escaping behavior will induce some vacancies of MAI on the surface of

perovskite /uniFB01 lm, and these defects can accelerate the nonradiative recombination process, which resulted in a decrease of carrier lifetime for the sample kept for a longer time.

In order to demonstrate that MAI vacancies are detrimental to the charge carrier lifetime, we tested the TRPL of sample before and after heat treatment at 250 ° C for 30 s, which will create plenty of MAI vacancies. The charge carrier lifetime decreased from 92 to 48 ns (Figure 5c) after heat treatment and recovered to 90 ns when the heated sample is vapor sprayed for 20 s. The results well support our hypothesis above. Due to the presence of plenty of MAI vacancies, it is not reasonable to explain this increase in carrier lifetime after spraying by removing excess MAI by water molecules. Furthermore, there is no di /uniFB00 erence in charge carrier lifetime of the /uniFB01 lms dipped into MAI solution (4 mg/mL in isoproponal) for 20 s (Figure 5d), which implies that excess MAI will not in /uniFB02 uence the recombination process. On the basis of the TRPL results, we attribute the mechanism of the reversible healing e /uniFB00 ect of water molecules to deactivating nonradiative recombination centers rather than removing excess MAI.

In order to directly evidence the deactivation e /uniFB00 ect we proposed above we use the impedance spectrum (IS) to extract the density of defect states in perovskite /uniFB01 lm, which is a wellestablished and widely used technique in dye-sensitized solar cells, 23 organic solar cells, 24 and perovskite solar cells. 25,26 Here, in our experiment, the IS measurements were performed under 10 mW cm -2 because the perturbation of the data under 100 mW cm -2 were too large to be analyzed, which may be caused by the photoinduced reversible structural transformation in perovskite /uniFB01 lms. 27 We used an equivalent circuit (Figure S2, Supporting Information)to /uniFB01 t the plots and then extracted related recombination time constants ( τ rec = R rec × C rec ). Figure 6 shows the τ rec extracted under di /uniFB00 erent bias voltages ( V bias ) for the three types of samples. It is shown that τ rec increase about 200% around V bias = 0 V and 150% around V oc after vapor spray (Figure 6a and 6b), indicating that water molecules can e /uniFB00 ectively suppress the recombination process in devices. Additionally, the sprayed/dried sample has a shorter τ rec compared to the sprayed sample. This decrease of τ rec can be attributed to the defect states induced by evaporation of water molecules.

The density of defect states can be derived by the angular frequency-dependent capacitance using the equation 28,29

=--N f V V qW C f f kT () ( ) d d t p bi ap (1)

where V bi , W , and V app stand for the build-in voltage, width of the space charge region, and applied voltage, respectively. Then the X axis should be turned from frequency to energetic distance E a = E t -E x ( E x = E c or E v ) using thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS). 30 Finally, we have the energetic defect distribution under di /uniFB00 erent applied bias voltages as the equation

as shown in Figures 7a -c and S3, Supporting Information.In the control sample, there are two defect states: one located at a shallow level ( E a < 0.27 eV) and another located at a deep level ( E a = 0.295 eV) (Figure 7a). However, the two defect states change into one locating around E a = 0.28 eV in the sprayed sample (Figure 7b). In contrast, the sprayed/dried sample also

has two defect states which overlap with each other to some extent (Figure 7c). The results suggest that water molecules can heal perovskite crystals by changing defect states from deep level to shallow level reversibly.

It is very challenging to directly prove the interaction between water molecules and perovskite crystal by means of H 1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for the reaction between

water molecules and the deuterated DMF or DMSO solvent. In the work by Li et al., 31 hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl in phosphonic acid ( -PO(OH) 2 ) end groups of the 4-ABPACl species and the iodide ion had been identi /uniFB01 ed by NMR data. It is believed that the hydroxyl in the water molecule and iodine ion in perovskite crystal can also bond in the same way. Because of the strong polarity in the water molecule, this interaction will be nontrivial, leading to an extra energy part in

Sherdinger ' s equation to describe the electronic surface states. Also, the corresponding energy eigenstate will be shifted to another value. Herein, we found that the energy level of these surface defects decreases after vapor spray, proved by the energetic defect distribution data obtained from IS measurement (Figure 7a -c). If the corresponding energy eigenstate shifts from deep-level states to shallow-level states due to such interaction, we call it defects passivation or deactivation, which had already been demonstrated in previous work. 17,32 This is consistent with the work by Xu et al., 17 which proved that recombination centers of Pb -I antistite defects can be deactivated upon interacting with PCBM. The deactivation process occurs when water molecules absorb on the perovskite /uniFB01 lm (Figure 7dto7e) and the defect states distribution change to the initial state after water molecules evaporate from the /uniFB01 lm (Figure 7eto7f). We know that defects like interstitials or

antisites associated with Pb and I form electronic trap states inside the band gap and deep defect states ( E trap > 250 meV), 33 which strongly capture both free charge carriers. This process induces accelerated recombination and is highly detrimental to device performance. Thus, the deactivation e /uniFB00 ect can improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells by reducing the nonradiative recombination centers.

In summary, we found that water molecules can improve the quality of perovskite /uniFB01 lms and promote the device performance reversibly. To /uniFB01 nd the origin of the reversible healing e /uniFB00 ect, we investigated the in /uniFB02 uence of water molecules through the change of carrier lifetime, recombination time constant, and density of defect states. On the basis of our research, the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl in water and the iodide ion in perovskite is believed to induce the deactivation process, changing the deep defect states to shallow ones and resulting in a reversible healing e /uniFB00 ect. Due to the reversibility of this healing e /uniFB00 ect, water molecules may be not an ideal material to heal the perovskite crystal. However, this study opens up opportunities for more stable molecular modi /uniFB01 cation with hydroxyl on perovskite /uniFB01 lms to improve the device performance.

## ■ METHODS

Device Fabrication. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or J&K Scienti /uniFB01 c Ltd. unless otherwise stated. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated on FTO-coated glass (Pilkington, Nippon Sheet Glass). First, laser-patterned, FTOcoated glass substrates were cleaned in deionized water, acetone, and ethanol followed by ultraviolet treatment for 10 min. Compact layers were deposited on the substrates by spin coating titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution

(75% in 2-propanol) diluted in ethanol (1:20, volume ratio) two times and annealed at 450 ° C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to a hot plate at 90 ° C before spin coating.

CH 3 NH 3 I and PbCl 2 (Aldrich) (3:1) for 430 and 250 mg/ mL solution was stirred in DMF at 60 ° C for 12 h. The resulting solution was then coated onto the TiO 2 /FTO substrate by spin coating at 500 and 2500 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 10 and 30 s, respectively. Then the substrate was dried on a hot plate at 60 ° C for 45 min and sintered at 100 and 105 ° C for 50/50 min. After cooing to room temperature, the /uniFB01 lm went through a 2 h postannealing process at 70 ° C.

For the spray treatment, we use a supersonic vapor spray instrument and put the prepared perovskite /uniFB01 lms at the outlet of this instrument vertically. The supersonic vapor spray instrument was /uniFB01 xed at one-tenth of its maximum power and then sprayed for di /uniFB00 erent times. For the vacuum treatment, the sprayed /uniFB01 lms were put in a vacuum container immediately after spray treatment and then pumped constantly for 30 min.

The hole transport material (HTM) was spin coated onto the perovskite /uniFB01 lm at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The spin-coating formulation was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of 2,2 ' ,7,7 ' -tetrakis( N , N -p -dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9 ' -spirobi /uniFB02 uorene(spiro-MeOTAD), purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co. Ltd., 30 mL of 4tert -butylpyridine (tBP), and 20 /uni03BC L of a stock solution of 520 mg/mL lithium bis(tri /uniFB02 uoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 90 nm thick gold electrodes were deposited on top of the devices by evaporation at ∼ 10 -4 mbar. The active area of the electrode was /uniFB01 xed at 9 mm 2 .

Device Characterization. The current -voltage ( J -V ) characteristics were obtained using an Agilent B2900 Series precision source/measure unit, and the cell was illuminated by a solar simulator (Solar IV-150A, Zolix) under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm -2 ). Light intensity was calibrated with a Newport calibrated KG5/uniFB01 ltered Si reference cell. We use a black mask to de /uniFB01 ne the cell ' s area, and the masking e /uniFB00 ect is con /uniFB01 rmed by testing the J sc with and without it, which has a 5% J sc di /uniFB00 erence. The J -V curves are tested from 1.5 to -0.2 V with a scan velocity of 100 mV/s. The masked active area is 9 mm 2 . For the steady-state e /uniFB03 ciency measurement, the applied voltage is /uniFB01 xed at 0.7 V; then the current value is recorded every 0.1 s. After around 3 s, the current increases slowly when the light turns on. All measurements were conducted in the nitrogen glovebox.

For XRD measurement, X-ray powder diagrams were recorded on an X ' PertMPD PRO from PANalytical equipped with a ceramic tube (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060A), a secondary graphite (002) monochromator, and a RTMS X ' Celerator detector and operated in BRAGG-BRENTANO geometry. The samples were mounted without further modi /uniFB01 cation, and the automatic divergence slit and beam mask were adjusted to the dimensions of the thin /uniFB01 lms. A step size of 0.008 ° was chosen and an acquisition time of up to 7.5 min/deg. A baseline correction was applied to all X-ray powder diagrams to remove the broad di /uniFB00 raction peak arising from the amorphous glass slide.

The surface morphology of the perovskite thin /uniFB01 lm was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Nano430, FEI). The instrument uses an electron beam accelerated at 15 kV.

For PL mapping, the photoluminescence maps were recorded using a HORIBA/LabRAM HR Evolution. The

modulated pump laser beam (455 nm) was focused onto the sample with submicrometer resolution using a confocal microscope objective. To collect a map, the sample position was varied with a piezoelectric stage.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a He -Cd laser (325 nm in wavelength) and green laser (532 nm in wavelength) guided by a microzone confocal Raman spectroscope (Renishaw inVia microRaman system) as the laser beam with a spot size diameter of 2 /uni03BC m. The collected duration is ∼ 5 ms. The time-resolved /uniFB02 uorescence spectra were recorded with a high-resolution streak camera system (Hamamatsu C10910). We used an ampli /uniFB01 ed mode-lock Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser system (Legend, Coherent) and a two-stage optical parametric ampli /uniFB01 er (OperA Solo, Coherent) to generate the pump beam with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. All samples were excited by 517 nm at room temperature with ∼ 110 nJ cm -2 .

The impedance spectrum was measured using a potentiostat/ galvanostat (SP-150, Bio-Logic, France). The frequency can be tuned from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with 70 data points, and at each point 200 measurements were averaged to smooth the impedance spectra. All samples were measured under 10 mW cm -2 using a 1/10 optical attenuator.
