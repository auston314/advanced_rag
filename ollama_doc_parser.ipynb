      "\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT excel at diverse tasks when given explicit instructions, yet they often struggle with specialized domains such as molecular science, lacking in-depth reasoning and sophisticated planning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce ChatMol Copilot, a chatbot-like agent specifically engineered for protein design and small molecule computations. Chat-Mol Copilot employs a multi-level abstraction framework to expand the LLM's capability. At the basic level, it integrates external computational tools through function calls, thus offloading complex tasks and enabling a focus on strategic decision-making. The second level is data abstraction. Large data sets (such as a large number of molecules created by a generative model) are stored in Redis cache, and the redis keys are referenced by LLMs for data sources involved in computation. The third level of abstraction allows the LLM to orchestrate these tools, either directly or via dynamically generated Python executables. Our evaluations demonstrate that ChatMol Copilot can adeptly manage molecular modeling tasks, effectively utilizing a variety of tools as directed. By simplifying access to sophisticated molecular modeling resources, ChatMol Copilot stands to significantly accelerate drug discovery and biotechnological innovation, empowering biochemists with advanced, user-friendly Al capabilities. The open-sourced code is available at https://github.com/ChatMol/ChatMol\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with specialized tools are catalyzing significant advancements across various scientific fields. In chemistry research, platforms like Coscientist (Boiko et al., 2023) and Chemcrow (M. Bran et al., 2024) have revolutionized lab automation and computational tasks. Furthermore, the novel Code Act approach, which utilizes \"Code as Action,\" leverages the coding prowess of LLMs to automate complex processes (Wang et al., 2024). Similarly, tools such as AlphaFold 3 (Abramson et al., 2024) have achieved remarkable success in predicting protein interactions and structures, underscoring the potential of computational methods in molecular biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these strides, significant challenges persist in the molecular engineering field, particularly regarding the execution of complex modeling tasks and the interpretation of their outcomes (Greener et al., 2022). These challenges stem from a need for greater automation and a more intuitive interaction with computational tools. In response, we introduce ChatMol Copilot, a dedicated platform that enhances molecular modeling computations. ChatMol Copilot is designed with a multi-level abstraction framework to maximize automation and user-friendliness. At its foundation, it integrates external computational tools via function calls, simplifying the interface to show only inputs, outputs, and functional descriptions, thereby isolating the LLM from complex computational details. The advanced layer of this framework allows the LLM to either orchestrate these tools directly or through dynamically generated Python executables. This paper demonstrates how ChatMol Copilot effectively manages molecular modeling tasks and delivers precise, actionable responses to user inquiries, significantly streamlining the computational workflow in molecular science.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 ChatMol Copilot Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "The ChatMol Copilot is designed around the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The system architecture aims to optimize workflow efficiency and precision in molecular modeling tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workflow Overview (Figure 1): The process begins with user instructions, which are interpreted by the LLM. This interpretation step determines\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "whether the user's request can be directly answered or if it necessitates the use of specialized tools. ChatMol Copilot supports a broad range of molecular modeling applications, encompassing both small molecules (such as pharmaceuticals) and macromolecules (such as proteins and their interactions). In addition to pre-defined tools, the system can create new tools by writing and executing Python code. This significantly expands its capabilities beyond the predefined action space. Data abstraction is employed to alleviate the burden of data processing from LLMs. Besides internal data usage, the system has access to significant biological databases, enabling it to retrieve and utilize publicly available data as needed. As conversations progress, the integration of user demands with the computational capabilities of ChatMol Copilot facilitates the completion of increasingly complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Equipped Tools\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous specialized neural networks have been developed for various molecular property prediction tasks (Wu et al., 2018). ChatMol Copilot integrates a range of tools to meet diverse computational needs, enabling comprehensive and efficient analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural Network-Based Tools: For tools that utilize neural network inference, such as ESMFold (Lin et al., 2023) and ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al., 2022), we have implemented publicly accessible APIs. This ensures minimal hardware requirements for users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local Execution Tools: For faster, Python-based tools, execution is handled locally on the user's computer. Examples include RDKit (Landrum et al., 2013) and TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). Table 1 lists the primary tools integrated into the system for both small molecule and macromolecule analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Integration with Microservices\n",
      "\n",
      "Microservices are a staple in modern cloud computing architectures due to their scalability and modularity. Each microservice operates independently with a well-defined API and service description. In the ChatMol framework, we have developed a generic method for integrating these microservices into the ChatMol toolbox see Table 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each microservice in our registry, Python code is generated based on the input parameter descriptions. This code is then wrapped into a standard function call, compiled on-the-fly, and added to our function calling list. As new microservices are registered, the function list is automatically updated, greatly enhancing the toolbox's capabilities while simplifying ongoing maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Figure 2: General protein design task.](attachment:image-1.png)\n",

      "*Figure 2: General protein design task. Text within purple boxes are instructions from users, and text within green boxes are answers given by ChatMol Copilot. Texts colored blue with underlines are hyperlinks for download files. The table and cartoon represented protein are real screen shots from the GUI of ChatMol Copilot.*\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3 Code as Actions and Redis Cache\n",
      "\n",
      "Expanding the system's capabilities can be achieved through the automatic generation and execution of code, known as CodeAct. In ChatMol Copilot, we implemented a generic Python code executor and a universal data object access mechanism using Redis cache. Code generation can be based on task descriptions and knowledge from documents. Redis cache and generic data object read/write operations in code enabling the LLM to manage tasks and data flow much simpler by referencing data with their keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Use Cases of ChatMol Copilot for Molecular Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "This section showcases four examples demonstrating the wide-ranging capabilities of ChatMol Copilot in molecular modeling tasks. These use cases illustrate how ChatMol Copilot adheres to user instructions, utilizing appropriate tools from its equipped toolkit and microservices to meet the demands of biochemists, from protein modeling to small molecule de novo synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 General Protein Design Task\n",
      "\n",
      "Proteins, essential macromolecules in cells, perform various biological functions, including DNA duplication, metabolic reaction catalysis, and cell cycle regulation. They are also pivotal in healthcare as therapeutic agents like insulin and antibodies, and in various industries as catalysts for cleaner energy and chemicals (Huang et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "A fundamental challenge in protein design is to find a sequence that folds into a desired structure (Dauparas et al., 2022). This task is complicated by epistasis, where residue-residue interactions can lead to misfolding and loss of function. To address this, we utilized ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al., 2022) for sequence design and ESMFold (Lin et al., 2023) to predict the fold of the designed sequences. The effectiveness of the designs was validated by comparing their structures to the initial templates, with ChatMol Copilot presenting the results in a well-organized table format. Key metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSD) and TM-score are highlighted to assess the structural integrity of the designed sequences Figure 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 Peptide/MHC-II Binding Affinity Prediction\n",
      "\n",
      "The prediction of binding affinity between peptides and MHC-II complexes is critical for assessing the immunogenic potential of newly designed proteins (Jensen et al., 2018). In this use case, Chat-Mol Copilot was tasked with mutating a peptide sequence five times randomly, then calculating and tabulating the binding affinities of these variants\n",

Random generation of molecules with no constraints. The output is a set of SMILES strings of the generated molecules. The input parameter is the number of molecules to be generated. 2) SuperStructure. In super structure generation, new molecules are generated based on a starting core. A smiles of the starting core need to be provided. 3) MotifExtend. In motif extension, we are interested in generating a molecule containing a given motif as a starting point. The extension point of the motif need to be labelled. 4) LinkerGen. Linker generation for linking two fragments. The smiles of two terminal fragments need to be provided in the inputs.\n",
