      "ChatGPT answer: The American Revolution was a pivotal event that took place in the 18th century, where the thirteen American colonies broke away from British rule to form the United States of America. The revolution was fueled by growing resentment towards British taxation policies, lack of representation in Parliament, and a desire for independence. The conflict lasted from 1775 to 1783 and culminated in the Treaty of Paris, which officially recognized the United States as an independent nation. The American Revolution had a profound impact on world history, inspiring other countries to fight for their own independence and shaping the foundations of modern democracy.\n",

      "## 1.1 What is VB2000?\n",
      "\n",
      "VB2000 is an ab initio electronic structure package for performing modern Valence Bond calculations based on a highly efficient VB algorithm—the so called Algebrant Algorithm. It has a general implementation of the Group Function (GF) Theory, in which a large molecule is described in terms of its constituent parts of physically identifiable \"electron groups\". The modern VB method implemented in VB2000 produces CASSCF(N,N) quality wave functions with only a small fraction of CPU cost for a CASSCF calculation for N>10. The combination of efficient VB methods and the general implementation GF theory in VB2000 makes it a very powerful tool with the investigation of the nature of chemical bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of VB2000 has been motivated by two main considerations. First, there is a need to obtain high-precision electronic wave functions, capable of giving quantitative substance to the empirical and intuitive ideas distilled from more than two hundred years of experimental chemistry. There exist within molecules \"structural units\" such as chemical bonds and functional groups, often with highly individual properties, which are transferable from one environment to another with little change; the behavior of such units conforms, in many cases, to empirical \"additivity rules\" which have never received a convincing theoretical explanation. Second, although valence bond theory, as developed in the 'thirties and forties', was brilliantly successful in rationalizing such ideas, within the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics, it failed completely to provide rigorous quantitative predictions. The reason was simply that for a system of N electrons the computational cost of ab initio VB calculations tended to grow like N factorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "With use of the Algebrant Algorithm, ab initio VB calculations on systems with up to about 14 electrons are now becoming 'routine' — even though N! is then of the order 9×1010. However, the majority of molecules of real chemical interest possess far more than 14 electrons. It therefore becomes mandatory to make some kind of conceptual 'separation' of a larger molecule into smaller and more tractable components. By using the Group Function (GF) approach for this purpose, VB2000 brings molecules with many groups within the scope of rigorous non-empirical investigation. Even though the current release has a limitation to a maximum of 16 electrons for each VB group, the full VB calculation of up to a 16-electron group is technically feasible with even a home PC. With the VB2000 program, innovative VB calculations on relatively large molecules can be performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following special features of VB2000 should be noted: the program has been carefully engineered and is highly modular. There is in principle no limit to the number of electron groups that can be recognized; the larger the molecule, the larger the number of groups to be selected. The actual form of each group function is entirely at the discretion of the user. VB2000 provides a general platform for GF calculations of any kind (e.g. using a VB function for one group and a CASVB (CASSCF equivalent) function for another). Both CASSCF and GVB methods can be considered as special cases of GF Theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology used ensures that calculated energies are true variational upper bounds and that the results obtained are size consistent. The detailed forms of the group functions are not prescribed at the beginning of a calculation (as they were in early GF calculations [9], where the global basis was partitioned into subsets, each considered adequate for describing a particular group); they are determined variationally as a result of optimization of the wave function for the entire system, subject only to a strong-orthogonality constraint. This permits the study of chemical reactions, for instance, in which the subsystems representing reactants and products may have forms which change quite dramatically during the reaction process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, even a simple one-structure VB wave function can recover most of the corresponding CASSCF correlation energy with only a small fraction of the CPU cost for the CAS calculation. The use of wave functions of VB type for the groups of greatest chemical interest ensures correct behavior when bond-breaking processes occur within a group, and also ensures that the wave functions describing separate fragments possess a high degree of localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GF theory approach used in VB2000 leads to wave functions which are highly compact and therefore provide clear links with chemistry and 'chemical intuition'. For example, the electron density for the entire molecule is always the sum of the densities of its constituent parts -- even though the forms of the group densities may change appreciably in some chemical processes. This provides a firm basis for the discussion of the 'additivity rules' which apply to many molecular properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very often only a small part of a large molecule is responsible for certain chemical and physical properties. The great flexibility of VB2000 allows one to study such a limited region, with a high-precision wave function, using more approximate group functions (such as Hartree-Fock) to calculate the mean field provided by the rest of the molecule.\n",
      "\n",
      "One important feature of the VB method is that the optimized orbitals tend to be highly localized. The GF framework combined with localized VB group functions provides the possibility of developing a linear scaling algorithm for truly large systems by harnessing the exponentially increasing computer power.\n",

      "## 1.2 What is new in version 3.0?\n",
      "\n",
      "The VB2000 3.0 release was initially intended to be the 2.8 version, but due to significant postponements in the release and the inclusion of two new developers into the VB2000 team, we have renamed it as the 3.0 version for the public release in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "This version is primarily due to developments that removes restrictions on the kind of GAMESS calculation that is used to construct initial guess orbitals in GAMESS/VB2000. Now all values of SCFTYP can be used, allowing UHF, GVB and MCSCF orbitals, in addition to RHF and ROHF. All kinds of DFT orbitals can be used. MP2, coupled-cluster and configuration interaction can be calculated but the HF orbitals are used. GVB is restricted to closed shell and uses the actual “bond” GVB orbitals after using localized orbitals to calculate the GVB CI pairs. The GVB orbitals can be a particularly good initial guess to use VB2000 for more advanced VB methods than GVB-PP. RUNTYP = OPTIMIZE and RUNTYP = HESSIAN can now be used to optimize the geometry or calculate frequencies with the GAMESS method before doing a VB2000 calculation, as well as optimizing the geometry or calculate frequencies with the VB method. RUNTYP =IRC and RUNTYP = SURFACE can be used with a range of GAMESS methods, calculating VB function at each point.\n",
      "\n",
      "$GMSPATH/vb2000/DOC/GMS_VB_test.README explains these methods in more detail and describes a set of test files for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other new features are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A *.vec file can be created containing a GAMESS like $VEC file for initial orbitals. MOs, LMOs and final VB orbitals. This is now supported by MacMolPlt which labels the orbitals correctly\n",
      "- Molden files can now be read directly by the stand-alone version, to use the basis set, geometry and MOs directly from another program.\n",
      "- VB calculations can be done after a optimisation or Hessian with another method or along an IRC or set of saddle points calculate with another method.\n",
      "- VB2000 can now use the structures for a set of ionicities (number of double occupied orbitals) or, equivalently, seniority numbers (number of singly occupied orbitals).\n",
      "- The Generalized Product Function Energy Partitioning code from the Nascimanto Group in Brazil was added to the GAMESS/VB2000 version.\n",
      "- See the CHANGELOG and Change_VB2.7-3.0.pdf in the DOC directory for more details and for other developments.\n",

      "## 1.3 What was new in version 2.7?\n",
      "\n",
      "The VB2000 2.7 release is primarily due to the development of a new way of using Gaussian with VB2000, but there have been many other improvements, which were applied into the GAMESS 2014 release. The new Gaussian/VB2000 version is in the directory “g09-vb2000” below the VB2000 directory. The Gaussian/VB2000 version can calculate centroids of orbitals, but not extents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other new features are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Changes to the VBOLIB system for the GAMESS version. The number of VBOLIBs has been reduced in this release, but additional VBOLIBs are now created on the fly for the addition of polarization functions and diffuse functions. For example, there is now only one VBOLIB for the 6-31G basis sets with VBOLIBs for 6-31G*, 6-31G**, 6-31G++G**, 6-31G(2df,p) and many more created on the fly. The new Gaussian/VB2000 version uses a similar approach but also creates VBOLIBs for spherical harmonics from Cartesian VBOLIBs on the fly. A new VBLOLIB for 6-311G has been created but for H and 1st row elements only.\n",
      "- BRILLMASK has been extended to automatically create the mask conditions for the case of localization of VB orbitals to just atoms.\n",
      "- A new visualization directive $DENSCUBE creates CUBE file for the total density, the density of specific groups and, for open shell systems, the spin density.\n",
      "- Since both GAMESS and Gaussian with conventional integral storage have both been extended to use h and i basis functions, VB2000 has been extended in this way. However SPHER can not be used with such basis sets and a bug in Gaussian (fixed for the next release) prevents the use g, h and i with Cartesian basis sets.\n",
      "- The vb2blas.src file has been renamed to vb2000-so.src and it now contains routines, previously in vb2000.src, that are only used in the stand-alone version.\n",
      "- Greater control over maximum values for many parameters has been introduced and is explained in Appendix I.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1.4 What was new in version 2.6?\n",
      "\n",
      "The VB2000 2.6 release is primarily due to the fact that from this point VB2000 will be released as part of the official GAMESS(US) release. Everything needed to get the GAMESS(US)/VB2000 program working will be found in the directory “vb2000” below the “gamess” directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are however some new features:\n",
      "\n",
      "- $MOLDEN added to the visualization directives to produce a Molden format file for use by the Molden program.\n",
      "- Extension of the $PLTORB visualization directive to read data so that a “ready to go” input file is prepared for the pltorb program. Previously the file produced had to be manually edited.\n",
      "- Make the visualization routines prepare files for the LMOs, rather than the VB orbitals, if the TEST directive is on the command line.\n",
      "- Improved memory allocation in GAMESS(US)/VB2000. It now uses the maximum of the remaining memory from the GAMESS code or that specified by $MEMORY\n",

      "- 64 bit Linux system support. This allows access to much larger memory.\n",
      "- Extension for Spin-Coupled method. A new method SC(m,n) is added, where m is the number of electrons, and n is the number of orbitals. In the new definition, SC(m,n) specifies all spin-coupled states of all electron configurations of m electrons in n orbitals. The configurations are defined as those that have the maximum number of occupied orbitals. When m=n, SC(m,n) becomes the original SC method (7)\n",
      "- Localized non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock calculations. Better localized orbitals with better transferability can be obtained. Overlap penalty is used for the optimization of non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals. This is necessary to avoid the collapsing of non-orthogonal MOs.\n",

      "\n",
      "- VB2000 has been fully integrated into two major quantum chemistry programs, GAMESS(US) and Gaussian so that some of the functionalities of GAMESS(US) and Gaussian can be used for VB wave function. See the Installation Guide.\n",
      "- Valence Bond Orbital (VBO) Library Files have been introduced for construction of initial VB orbitals. The simple intuitive expression of VBOs provides extreme flexibility for VBO construction.\n",
      "- The limitation for the number of basis functions for the integral module has been removed so that larger molecules can be treated in the stand-alone version.\n",
      "- Graphic utilities have been added for VB orbital visualization.\n",
      "- There have been other technical enhancements:\n",
      "- Introduced a 'dot' notation for group function calculations.\n",
      "- Introduced dynamic memory allocation.\n",
      "- Added many more built-in basis sets.\n",
      "- General efficiency has been Improved.\n",

      "The Pipek-Mezey MO localization algorithm becomes ill conditioned when orbitals are nearly localized on the same atom; this is because the localized molecular orbital (LMO) function value changes very little for the mixing of two orbitals nearly localized on the same atom. For this reason, the final LMO orbital coefficients and the LMO orbital energies becomes very sensitive to the convergence criteria and platforms. Even though in most VB calculations, the small differences of LMO do not affect the final results, it can cause confusion. To reduce the numerical instability of the PM localization, we added some numerical controls; if the change in value of the objective function of an LMO is smaller than a certain threshold, then do not perform orbital rotation. Another condition to improve the stability is to first prevent the orbital mixing of energetically close MOs. Thus the inner atom core orbitals of different energies on the same atoms are not allowed to be mixed at the beginning. In this way, the mixing of orbitals localized on the same atom is reduced significantly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the CASVB is a full CI wave function in a subspace, the orbitals that span the orbital space could be totally arbitrary. One method to reduce the arbitrariness is to use a localization scheme. In CASVB calculations, the orbitals are not necessary orthogonal to each other, therefore this gives some extra flexibility for the orbital localization. To take advantage of this, a method to achieve the maximum localization of an VB orbitals has been introduced and implemented in VB2000. In this method, the CASVB calculation starts from a set of good initial VBOs, and the localization is performed at the last macro iteration to maximize the localization object function for each VBO within the CAS orbital subspace. This procedure leads to a set of highly localized AO-like orbitals, and the CASVB wave functions are usually very compact (i.e. only a few VB structures give significant contributions).\n",

      "A Hartree-Fock molecular orbital calculation is the starting point for any other type of calculation. Although VB2000 is not designed for pure Hartree-Fock (HF) method, we have made a number of improvements over the last few years. One major improvement is that the maximum number of basis functions that can be handled by the program has been significantly increased. The HF orbitals are used for electron group assignment, initial guess of VB orbitals and initial one-electron densities of all groups based on Pipek-Mezey localization as described in the next section.\n",

      "The Pipek-Mezey (PM) method for localization of molecular orbitals (MOs) has been implemented. This utility plays a critical role in VB2000. First, the LMOs provide a solid base for dividing electrons into spatially separable groups. The LMOs of each electron groups are the starting points for generating the initial group functions and the corresponding one-electron densities. One of the initial guess methods for VB orbitals is to split each bonding LMO into two overlapping AO-like orbitals. See more details in Chapter 7. The PM method is based on a simple criterion: the localized MOs should maximize the sum of the squares of Mulliken charges of all atoms from each individual MO. The PM algorithm is also very simple, being based on successive rotations of orbital pairs. This method usually leads to results which are remarkably similar to those obtained from more sophisticated methods, and the cost in CPU time is quite negligible.\n",

      "## 3.4 Group Function Theory and its combination with VB method\n",
      "\n",
      "As indicated in the Introduction, an essential feature of VB2000 is the implementation of the Group Function Theory, in which a molecular wave function is expressed as an antisymmetrized product of individual group functions [6-8]. The spin-orbitals (one electron 'groups') of a Slater determinant are thus replaced by many-electron group functions - each of which may allow a considerable degree of intra group electron correlation. In VB2000, the electron-correlated group functions are obtained by the VB method. Even though the general mathematical formulation of this approach was completed more than four decades ago and it provides a unifying frame work for many varieties of electron correlation calculations, the general implementation of GF Theory, especially its combination with VB method, was introduced for the first time in VB2000. The general implementation of GF Theory in VB2000 provides tremendous flexibility for this type of computation: a molecular system can be divided into any number of electron groups and each group can be treated at any level of electron correlation of the user's choice. A common scenario is that a higher level of theory (such as CASVB) is used for the most critical regions in a molecule, for instance the bond breaking and forming region, while for the remaining parts some less accurate methods (such as simple VB, even Hartree-Fock) are used. Even though the general idea of using different levels of theory for different part of a molecule is somewhat similar to QM/MM or ONIOM, the approach in VB2000 is fundamentally different from QM/MM and ONIOM. In QM/MM, the system is not described in full quantum mechanics, and the QM/MM boundary is usually a source of trouble due to the lack of consistency for treating a molecule system. ONIOM is basically a highly sophisticated interpolation method based on the computation of different sizes of model systems and different levels of theory. In contrast, the GFT method is a fully quantum mechanical method with a consistent Hamiltonian. Moreover, the approach as a whole is variational.\n",

      "\n",
      "VB2000 provides a functionality for the automatic calculation of the energy profile of a chemical reaction along the reaction path guided by a few intermediate structures (such as reactant, transition state, and product etc.). Only for the simplest cases, the Linear Synchronous Transition (LST) method is a good approximation for the reaction path between reactant and product geometries. However, if a few good representative intermediate structures along the reaction path are available, one can use the linear\n",
      "interpolation between each two consecutive structures for constructing a reasonably good path for the whole reaction. Assume Gi and Gi+1 are two consecutive structures, and Gx is the linear interpolation point between them, then the Cartesian coordinates of Gx can be obtained from the following equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Gx = xGi + (1 - x)Gi+1\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the geometry change as smooth and possible, the structures Gi (i = 1,... NGeoms) should be aligned for the best overlap between each two consecutive structures. This is done automatically by the program using the Kabsch algorithm. The geometries of the representative structures along the reaction path can be obtained from an independent source (for instance, an IRC calculation at a lower level of theory, or even created manually according to some basic knowledge of a chemical reaction). VB2000 also provides controls for how fine the resolution is for the geometry changes along the reaction path. Details of the controls in the input are given in the INPUT section of this manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structure weights\n",
      "\n",
      "Important information from a multi-structure VB calculation is provided by the weights of the various VB structures. In VB2000, we have implemented four types of structure weight analysis, i.e. The Mulliken Type (also called Chirgwin-Coulson type[22]), Löwdin type[23], Gallup and Norbeck[24] and Hiberty type[25]. The structure weights of the types are calculated according to the following formulas. Let's assume that the multi-structure VB wave function is expressed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ψ = ∑i CiΨi\n",
      "\n",

      "Wi = ∑j Ci Cj Sij\n",
      "\n",
      "where Sij is the overlap of structure i and j.\n",

      "\n",
      "In most cases, VB orbitals are highly localized. The localized AO-like VB orbitals provide a clear picture that each VB structure corresponds to a Lewis structure unambiguously. However, it is not uncommon that the VB orbitals have considerable delocalization over to the neighbor atoms. Such a situation happens more often in special bonding patterns. Sometimes, it is not clear whether the delocalization has a strong physical driving force or just an outcome of variational optimization. To study this, one can force the VB orbitals to be localized and to see whether this has a significant impact on the energy of VB wavefunction or not. If the energy increases significantly due to the localization constraints, then one may add more ionic VB structures in the wave function, and thus we know the system has considerable contribution of ionic structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different ways to force VB orbital localization. One straight approach is to divide basis functions into groups, and only allow each VB orbital to be optimized within a particular predefined group of basis functions. This is the strict localization constraints as used in BOVB approach. A control for strict localization ($BRILLMASK) has been implemented in VB2000 version 2.0. Check out sections 6.4.5 and 8.19 for usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strict localization of VB orbitals is a too harsh constraint and may lead to too high energy. It is not only cumbersome to use but also is limited to some very simple systems. Therefore, we have introduced a more flexible control for localization enhancement of VB orbitals. In this control, an adjustable parameter, which can be considered as a parameter for the strength of localization, is used. If this parameter is set to zero, then the VB orbitals are optimized under no constraints. If this parameter is set to infinity, then the VB orbitals are strictly localized. A particular useful application of such a control is for the cases that the structure weight analysis is needed while the VB orbitals are significantly delocalized so that the structure weights become somewhat ambiguous. Another application is for the case that the localization patterns of the final optimized VB orbitals are different from the initial guess.\n",

      "### 4.2.1 Hartree-Fock calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step of a VB calculation is usually a Hartree-Fock molecular orbital calculation. The RHF method is used for a closed shell system and a quasi-ROHF method is used for an open shell system. In the quasi-ROHF method, the Fock matrix is constructed from the total density in the same as in the RHF method.\n",

      "### 4.2.2 Pipek-Mezey MO localization\n",
      "\n",
      "The canonical molecular orbitals from a Hartree-Fock calculation are transformed into a set of localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) by Pipek-Mezey method. The generated LMOs are used for the following two purposes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Group assignment for electrons on LMOs\n",
      "- Initial guess of VB orbitals by splitting bonding LMOs\n",
      "\n",
      "The LMOs are grouped in the following types and order: inner core orbitals, lone pairs, and bonding LMOs. For each type of LMOs, the orbitals are ordered in an ascendant order of their orbital energies. Each LMO has a label to indicate its type. The Mulliken population of each LMO is calculated and used to determine its LMO type. If a LMO has approximately equal electron distribution on two directly connected atoms, then this LMO is a bonding LMO between the two. If the population is localized on one atom, then it is either an inner core or a lone pair. If a LMO is localized on more than two atoms, and it is marked as a multi-center (MC) bonding orbital.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2.3 LMO group assignment\n",
      "\n",
      "The program does the LMO group assignment automatically according to the input. For simple VB calculations, the default assignment is usually what a user needs. For the above example, the input specifies VB(8), an eight-electron VB calculation. Since the molecule has 10 electrons in total, there is a Hartree-Fock core group with two electrons and a VB group with eight electrons. By default, VB2000 starts with the Hartree-Fock group and then the VB group(s) specified in the input. In the CH4 case, the first LMO is assigned to the Hartree-Fock group, and the remaining 4 LMOs, which are bonding orbitals corresponding to the 4 C-H bonds, are assigned to the VB group.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, the default LMO assignment may not be what you need. One should explicitly assign LMOs to the appropriate groups by using $LMOGRPMODIFY input. A more advanced control for the same purpose is $VBGA. See Chapter 6 for more details.\n",

Of course, one can always change the number of VB orbitals and the way for generating the initial VB orbitals by using addition controls in the input. See Chapter 6 for $##VBORB and $AOGROUP controls.\n",

      "The following advices may help you to run VB2000 more effectively for your systems:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If you want to run a multi-group VB calculation, specify the VB groups explicitly using the “dot” notation, such as VB(8).CASVB(6,6).VB(8). You can specify the same kind of calculation by using GPF(ng) and other controls, but the “dot” notation is much easier to use and intuitive.\n",
      "2. You can do a VB calculation of a molecule at one geometry and do another VB calculation on the same molecule at a different geometry by reading the VB orbitals of a previous calculation. This is not only a good way to speed up convergence of a new calculation, but also a necessary step for generating initial VB orbitals for a bond breaking calculation in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a VB group has many resonance structures and you have difficulty to determine which ones make major contributions, you can try a CASVB calculation first and then check the biggest contributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to avoid running CASVB or SCGVB for groups with large number of electrons (N>8 for CASVB and N>10 for SCGVB). If you want to run SCGVB(12), you can run a VB(12) for orbital optimization with one or a few structures, and then do a SCGVB(12) as a restart calculation without further\n",
      "optimization of VB orbitals (using key word CIONLY). SCGVB(11) and SCGVB(12) have 132 structures, which is just about feasible but not advised.\n",
      "SCGVB(13) and SCGVB(14) have 429 structures which is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spin-density calculation can be very time consuming for group with more than 12 electrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "If VBSCF for VB orbital optimization becomes unstable, you can add a constant to Hessian diagonal elements by using $HESSCONST, starting from 0.1. A larger value can make the iteration more stable, but it can slow down the convergence. Use PRINTALL option to watch closely the iterations and adjust the parameter so that you can get the converged results without slowing down the iteration too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the DIIS option can reduce the chance of symmetry broken solutions if you wish to keep certain symmetry. See Chapter 6 for more details about key word DIIS. However, the DIIS option sometimes can lead to false convergence.\n",

      "## 5.6 VB, VBSCF, SCGVB (SC or SCVB), BOVB, CASVB and CASSCF\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much confusion in the literature concerning VB terminology. In this section we try to clarify the one used in our present work. Most of the differences among VB computations are purely technical. The term 'VB calculation' generally means the wave function is constructed in VB form by defining VB orbitals and their spin-pairing patterns. In modern VB calculations the VB orbitals are usually optimized in some self-consistent way and this gives rise to the term 'VBSCF method'.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple cases (e.g. for a saturated molecule) a single VB structure can often provide a fairly good description of the electronic structure; but cases where the chemical bonds cannot be plausibly assigned in any unique way (as in reactions, where bonds may be continually formed or broken) a single structure is inadequate. No single pairing scheme serves to give a good description of the whole structure or process and a multi-structure VB function becomes necessary. One such a choice is the so-called Spin-Coupled or, more recently renamed, Spin-Coupled Generalised Valence Bond wavefunction in VB form (SCGVB), which uses one set of VB orbitals but all linearly independent spin-pairing patterns–without any change of orbital occupation numbers (i.e. without 'excitations'). SCGVB has been proposed as a compromise between the use of “full-GVB” mainly in the USA and SC or SCVB elsewhere. We support this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach used in describing bond-breaking/forming processes also employs a multi-structure VB function, but allows different sets of orbitals for different structures: this is the Breathing Orbital VB (or BOVB) method[26], in which the orbitals are allowed to expand or contract (i.e. 'breathe') on changing from one structure to another. The BOVB method can efficiently incorporate dynamic correlation in a VB wave function while keeping the compact form of the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CASVB calculation is mathematically equivalent to CASSCF: it involves a set of VB orbitals which define the Complete Active Space and includes all linearly independent spin-coupled functions that can be constructed from them. CASVB is not designed as an efficient alternative to CASSCF, but it has some advantages that CASSCF does not provide. In particular, the orbitals have no orthogonality constraints and so can be highly localized like atomic orbitals. Since the CAS wave function is invariant under orbital transformations in the active space, we can require maximum localization of the VBOs, without constraints, in any function of CASVB type – even with a limited number of structures. The CASVB wave function is then also highly compact, a few structures providing almost all significant contributions. One should note the CASVB method implemented in VB2000 is different from Cooper's CASVB approach, in which the CASSCF wave function is transformed into VB form of a subset of CASSCF space. VB2000 provides a very general implementation of VB theory and is capable of performing all the above types of calculation. The SCGVB and CASVB keywords in VB2000 allow one to perform the specified computation without knowing any of the details involved in constructing all the VB structures.\n",

      "## 5.7 Group Function Theory (GFT) vs. ORMAS\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, no other electronic structure program has a general implementation of group function theory which can perform full optimization of a wave function which is expressed as a generalized product of group function. GVB and MCSCF can be considered as two special cases of GFT. The Occupation Restricted Multiple Active Space Configuration Interaction (ORMAS) method has been introduced in GAMESS(US)[27,28]. The general philosophy of ORMAS has a certain similarity to GFT in terms of multiple groups. But the two methods are actually totally different both technically and theoretically. It would be interesting to compare the two methods. The ORMAS method involves two steps: first the active space (a set of active orbitals) is partitioned into an unrestricted number of orbitals, and secondly occupation restrictions are specified in the form of the minimal and maximal number of electrons allowed for each group. ORMAS can be considered the most general implementation of restricted active space SCF method, thus all other variations such CASSCF and the 3-group RASSCF can be recovered by appropriate specifications of the restriction parameters. ORMAS efficiently eliminates ineffective configurations in CI computation while keeping the flexibility to account the electron correlations among groups. One should be aware that the flexibility for group-group electron correlation comes at the price the number of exponentially increasing of configurations - even though such an increase is considerably reduced by the restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group function method approaches the electron correlation of large systems in a different way. It also involves two steps. The first step is similar to that of ORMAS, i.e. a molecule system can be partitioned into an unrestricted number of electron groups. The second step is quite different from ORMAS: 1) the number of electrons in each group is fixed, i.e. electrons are not hopping between different groups; 2) the wave function is expressed as the antisymmetrized product of group functions; 3) each group function is optimized in the mean field of the other groups thus the small inter-group correlation is neglected. A major advantage of this approach is that the computational cost increases only linearly with the number of groups instead of exponentially as in ORMAS. In principle, any correlation method can be used for the group function of a GF group. For instance, a GF group can be further divided into multiple subgroups and the ORMAS method can be applied to these subgroups.\n",

      "VB2000 is designed to balance the flexibility of controls and the convenience of usability. Most of the controls and options needed are automated as defaults, which in most cases work well. This automation reduces the input to a minimum. On the other hand, many controls can be customized and will overwrite the defaults with explicit input, thus providing the maximum flexibility. One should also understand that VB2000 is not designed as a black box. Input backed by chemical knowledge is essential to obtain insights into interesting chemical systems. VB2000 is designed to provide convenient controls to convert sophisticated theory into practice so as to test, verify and refine theoretical ideas about the nature of chemical bonds.

All linear independent spin-configuration of m electrons in m orbitals are included in an automatic way. Therefore, there is no essential difference between SCGVB(m) and VB(m) with multiple VB structures. SCGVB(m) provides a convenient shortcut for a special multiple-VB structure calculation that a user don't have to write all linear independent spin configurations explicitly. The keywords SC(m) and SCVB(m) can also be used. SCGVB is limited to 12 electrons. It seems that the changing of array bounds to have more structures is a long way short of what is needed. SCGVB(13) and SCGVB(14) have the same number of structures but the time and resources to complete that calculation makes it totally unattainable at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCGVB(m,n): We can ask ourselves: what would be the most natural way to extend Spin-Coupled method to systems where the number of electrons is not equal to the number of orbitals? In VB2000, we define it as the all spin-coupled states from all possible electron-orbital configurations which have the maximum number of occupied orbitals. For instance, in the case of SC(m,m), there only one such a configuration, that is all orbitals are occupied with one electron on each, and all spin-coupled states are from the spin-coupling schemes from this configuration. Thus SCGVB(m,m) = SCGVB(m). An essential advantage of SCGVB method is that the wave function and optimized orbitals are independent of the way to choose the Lewis structures of the SCGVB space, therefore, the results is not biased to any personal preference. As with SCGVB(m), the largest value of m is 12 but SCGVB(12,11) takes longer to run that SCGVB(12,12), One can make special use of SCGVB(m,n) when m = 2n, i.e. all orbitals are double-occupied. In this case, SCGVB option turns into non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock method. In VB2000, we use this trick to do non-orthogonal localized Hartree-Fock molecular orbital calculations. Even though for regular VB calculation the maximum number of electrons in each VB group is currently limited to 16, the non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock MO calculations does not have such a limitation. The limitation for the number of non-orthogonal molecular orbitals comes from the limit of total number of basis functions which can be handled by the program and the computational time. It should be noted that the non orthogonal Hartree-Fock MO computation is much more expensive than the regular Hartree-Fock method. CASVB(m,n)\n",

      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, VB2000 is an ab initio electronic structure package for performing modern Valence Bond calculations based on a highly efficient VB algorithm—the so called Algebrant Algorithm. It has a general implementation of the Group Function (GF) Theory, in which a large molecule is described in terms of its constituent parts of physically identifiable \"electron groups\". The modern VB method implemented in VB2000 produces CASSCF(N,N) quality wave functions with only a small fraction of CPU cost for a CASSCF calculation for N>10. The combination of efficient VB methods and the general implementation GF theory in VB2000 makes it a very powerful tool with the investigation of the nature of chemical bonds.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, The development of VB2000 has been motivated by two main considerations. First, there is a need to obtain high-precision electronic wave functions, capable of giving quantitative substance to the empirical and intuitive ideas distilled from more than two hundred years of experimental chemistry. There exist within molecules \"structural units\" such as chemical bonds and functional groups, often with highly individual properties, which are transferable from one environment to another with little change; the behavior of such units conforms, in many cases, to empirical \"additivity rules\" which have never received a convincing theoretical explanation. Second, although valence bond theory, as developed in the 'thirties and forties', was brilliantly successful in rationalizing such ideas, within the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics, it failed completely to provide rigorous quantitative predictions. The reason was simply that for a system of N electrons the computational cost of ab initio VB calculations tended to grow like N factorial.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, With use of the Algebrant Algorithm, ab initio VB calculations on systems with up to about 14 electrons are now becoming 'routine' — even though N! is then of the order 9×1010. However, the majority of molecules of real chemical interest possess far more than 14 electrons. It therefore becomes mandatory to make some kind of conceptual 'separation' of a larger molecule into smaller and more tractable components. By using the Group Function (GF) approach for this purpose, VB2000 brings molecules with many groups within the scope of rigorous non-empirical investigation. Even though the current release has a limitation to a maximum of 16 electrons for each VB group, the full VB calculation of up to a 16-electron group is technically feasible with even a home PC. With the VB2000 program, innovative VB calculations on relatively large molecules can be performed.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, The following special features of VB2000 should be noted: the program has been carefully engineered and is highly modular. There is in principle no limit to the number of electron groups that can be recognized; the larger the molecule, the larger the number of groups to be selected. The actual form of each group function is entirely at the discretion of the user. VB2000 provides a general platform for GF calculations of any kind (e.g. using a VB function for one group and a CASVB (CASSCF equivalent) function for another). Both CASSCF and GVB methods can be considered as special cases of GF Theory.\n",

      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, The methodology used ensures that calculated energies are true variational upper bounds and that the results obtained are size consistent. The detailed forms of the group functions are not prescribed at the beginning of a calculation (as they were in early GF calculations [9], where the global basis was partitioned into subsets, each considered adequate for describing a particular group); they are determined variationally as a result of optimization of the wave function for the entire system, subject only to a strong-orthogonality constraint. This permits the study of chemical reactions, for instance, in which the subsystems representing reactants and products may have forms which change quite dramatically during the reaction process.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, In most cases, even a simple one-structure VB wave function can recover most of the corresponding CASSCF correlation energy with only a small fraction of the CPU cost for the CAS calculation. The use of wave functions of VB type for the groups of greatest chemical interest ensures correct behavior when bond-breaking processes occur within a group, and also ensures that the wave functions describing separate fragments possess a high degree of localization.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, The GF theory approach used in VB2000 leads to wave functions which are highly compact and therefore provide clear links with chemistry and 'chemical intuition'. For example, the electron density for the entire molecule is always the sum of the densities of its constituent parts -- even though the forms of the group densities may change appreciably in some chemical processes. This provides a firm basis for the discussion of the 'additivity rules' which apply to many molecular properties.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, Very often only a small part of a large molecule is responsible for certain chemical and physical properties. The great flexibility of VB2000 allows one to study such a limited region, with a high-precision wave function, using more approximate group functions (such as Hartree-Fock) to calculate the mean field provided by the rest of the molecule.\n",
      "1.1 What is VB2000?, 5, -1, 1.1 What is VB2000?, One important feature of the VB method is that the optimized orbitals tend to be highly localized. The GF framework combined with localized VB group functions provides the possibility of developing a linear scaling algorithm for truly large systems by harnessing the exponentially increasing computer power.\n",

Now all values of SCFTYP can be used, allowing UHF, GVB and MCSCF orbitals, in addition to RHF and ROHF. All kinds of DFT orbitals can be used. MP2, coupled-cluster and configuration interaction can be calculated but the HF orbitals are used. GVB is restricted to closed shell and uses the actual “bond” GVB orbitals after using localized orbitals to calculate the GVB CI pairs. The GVB orbitals can be a particularly good initial guess to use VB2000 for more advanced VB methods than GVB-PP. RUNTYP = OPTIMIZE and RUNTYP = HESSIAN can now be used to optimize the geometry or calculate frequencies with the GAMESS method before doing a VB2000 calculation, as well as optimizing the geometry or calculate frequencies with the VB method.

      "The Pipek-Mezey MO localization algorithm becomes ill conditioned when orbitals are nearly localized on the same atom; this is because the localized molecular orbital (LMO) function value changes very little for the mixing of two orbitals nearly localized on the same atom. For this reason, the final LMO orbital coefficients and the LMO orbital energies becomes very sensitive to the convergence criteria and platforms. Even though in most VB calculations, the small differences of LMO do not affect the final results, it can cause confusion. To reduce the numerical instability of the PM localization, we added some numerical controls; if the change in value of the objective function of an LMO is smaller than a certain threshold, then do not perform orbital rotation. Another condition to improve the stability is to first prevent the orbital mixing of energetically close MOs. Thus the inner atom core orbitals of different energies on the same atoms are not allowed to be mixed at the beginning. In this way, the mixing of orbitals localized on the same atom is reduced significantly.\n",

One method to reduce the arbitrariness is to use a localization scheme. In CASVB calculations, the orbitals are not necessary orthogonal to each other, therefore this gives some extra flexibility for the orbital localization. To take advantage of this, a method to achieve the maximum localization of an VB orbitals has been introduced and implemented in VB2000. In this method, the CASVB calculation starts from a set of good initial VBOs, and the localization is performed at the last macro iteration to maximize the localization object function for each VBO within the CAS orbital subspace. This procedure leads to a set of highly localized AO-like orbitals, and the CASVB wave functions are usually very compact (i.e. only a few VB structures give significant contributions).\n",

One major improvement is that the maximum number of basis functions that can be handled by the program has been significantly increased.

The LMOs of each electron groups are the starting points for generating the initial group functions and the corresponding one-electron densities. One of the initial guess methods for VB orbitals is to split each bonding LMO into two overlapping AO-like orbitals. See more details in Chapter 7. The PM method is based on a simple criterion: the localized MOs should maximize the sum of the squares of Mulliken charges of all atoms from each individual MO. The PM algorithm is also very simple, being based on successive rotations of orbital pairs. This method usually leads to results which are remarkably similar to those obtained from more sophisticated methods, and the cost in CPU time is quite negligible.\n",

      "3.4 Group Function Theory and its combination with VB method, 34, -1, 3.4 Group Function Theory and its combination with VB method, As indicated in the Introduction, an essential feature of VB2000 is the implementation of the Group Function Theory, in which a molecular wave function is expressed as an antisymmetrized product of individual group functions [6-8]. The spin-orbitals (one electron 'groups') of a Slater determinant are thus replaced by many-electron group functions - each of which may allow a considerable degree of intra group electron correlation. In VB2000, the electron-correlated group functions are obtained by the VB method. Even though the general mathematical formulation of this approach was completed more than four decades ago and it provides a unifying frame work for many varieties of electron correlation calculations, the general implementation of GF Theory, especially its combination with VB method, was introduced for the first time in VB2000. The general implementation of GF Theory in VB2000 provides tremendous flexibility for this type of computation: a molecular system can be divided into any number of electron groups and each group can be treated at any level of electron correlation of the user's choice. A common scenario is that a higher level of theory (such as CASVB) is used for the most critical regions in a molecule, for instance the bond breaking and forming region, while for the remaining parts some less accurate methods (such as simple VB, even Hartree-Fock) are used. Even though the general idea of using different levels of theory for different part of a molecule is somewhat similar to QM/MM or ONIOM, the approach in VB2000 is fundamentally different from QM/MM and ONIOM. In QM/MM, the system is not described in full quantum mechanics, and the QM/MM boundary is usually a source of trouble due to the lack of consistency for treating a molecule system. ONIOM is basically a highly sophisticated interpolation method based on the computation of different sizes of model systems and different levels of theory. In contrast, the GFT method is a fully quantum mechanical method with a consistent Hamiltonian. Moreover, the approach as a whole is variational.\n",

The localized AO-like VB orbitals provide a clear picture that each VB structure corresponds to a Lewis structure unambiguously. However, it is not uncommon that the VB orbitals have considerable delocalization over to the neighbor atoms. Such a situation happens more often in special bonding patterns. Sometimes, it is not clear whether the delocalization has a strong physical driving force or just an outcome of variational optimization. To study this, one can force the VB orbitals to be localized and to see whether this has a significant impact on the energy of VB wavefunction or not. If the energy increases significantly due to the localization constraints, then one may add more ionic VB structures in the wave function, and thus we know the system has considerable contribution of ionic structures.\n",

In this control, an adjustable parameter, which can be considered as a parameter for the strength of localization, is used. If this parameter is set to zero, then the VB orbitals are optimized under no constraints. If this parameter is set to infinity, then the VB orbitals are strictly localized. A particular useful application of such a control is for the cases that the structure weight analysis is needed while the VB orbitals are significantly delocalized so that the structure weights become somewhat ambiguous. Another application is for the case that the localization patterns of the final optimized VB orbitals are different from the initial guess.\n",

In this section we try to clarify the one used in our present work. Most of the differences among VB computations are purely technical. The term 'VB calculation' generally means the wave function is constructed in VB form by defining VB orbitals and their spin-pairing patterns. In modern VB calculations the VB orbitals are usually optimized in some self-consistent way and this gives rise to the term 'VBSCF method'.\n",

No single pairing scheme serves to give a good description of the whole structure or process and a multi-structure VB function becomes necessary. One such a choice is the so-called Spin-Coupled or, more recently renamed, Spin-Coupled Generalised Valence Bond wavefunction in VB form (SCGVB), which uses one set of VB orbitals but all linearly independent spin-pairing patterns–without any change of orbital occupation numbers (i.e. without 'excitations'). SCGVB has been proposed as a compromise between the use of “full-GVB” mainly in the USA and SC or SCVB elsewhere. We support this change.\n",

The BOVB method can efficiently incorporate dynamic correlation in a VB wave function while keeping the compact form of the function.\n",

CASVB is not designed as an efficient alternative to CASSCF, but it has some advantages that CASSCF does not provide. In particular, the orbitals have no orthogonality constraints and so can be highly localized like atomic orbitals. Since the CAS wave function is invariant under orbital transformations in the active space, we can require maximum localization of the VBOs, without constraints, in any function of CASVB type – even with a limited number of structures. The CASVB wave function is then also highly compact, a few structures providing almost all significant contributions. One should note the CASVB method implemented in VB2000 is different from Cooper's CASVB approach, in which the CASSCF wave function is transformed into VB form of a subset of CASSCF space. VB2000 provides a very general implementation of VB theory and is capable of performing all the above types of calculation. The SCGVB and CASVB keywords in VB2000 allow one to perform the specified computation without knowing any of the details involved in constructing all the VB structures.\n",

GVB and MCSCF can be considered as two special cases of GFT. The Occupation Restricted Multiple Active Space Configuration Interaction (ORMAS) method has been introduced in GAMESS(US)[27,28]. The general philosophy of ORMAS has a certain similarity to GFT in terms of multiple groups. But the two methods are actually totally different both technically and theoretically. It would be interesting to compare the two methods. The ORMAS method involves two steps: first the active space (a set of active orbitals) is partitioned into an unrestricted number of orbitals, and secondly occupation restrictions are specified in the form of the minimal and maximal number of electrons allowed for each group. ORMAS can be considered the most general implementation of restricted active space SCF method, thus all other variations such CASSCF and the 3-group RASSCF can be recovered by appropriate specifications of the restriction parameters. ORMAS efficiently eliminates ineffective configurations in CI computation while keeping the flexibility to account the electron correlations among groups. One should be aware that the flexibility for group-group electron correlation comes at the price the number of exponentially increasing of configurations - even though such an increase is considerably reduced by the restrictions.\n",
      "5.7 Group Function Theory (GFT) vs. ORMAS, 60, -1, 5.7 Group Function Theory (GFT) vs. ORMAS, The group function method approaches the electron correlation of large systems in a different way. It also involves two steps. The first step is similar to that of ORMAS, i.e. a molecule system can be partitioned into an unrestricted number of electron groups. The second step is quite different from ORMAS: 1) the number of electrons in each group is fixed, i.e. electrons are not hopping between different groups; 2) the wave function is expressed as the antisymmetrized product of group functions; 3) each group function is optimized in the mean field of the other groups thus the small inter-group correlation is neglected. A major advantage of this approach is that the computational cost increases only linearly with the number of groups instead of exponentially as in ORMAS. In principle, any correlation method can be used for the group function of a GF group. For instance, a GF group can be further divided into multiple subgroups and the ORMAS method can be applied to these subgroups.\n",

      "6.2.1 Method, 64, -1, 6.2.1 Method, SCGVB(m): Spin-Coupled method (recently renamed SCGVB to remove the confusion of different names – SC, SCVB and full-GVB) is used for a set of m electrons in m orbitals. All linear independent spin-configuration of m electrons in m orbitals are included in an automatic way. Therefore, there is no essential difference between SCGVB(m) and VB(m) with multiple VB structures. SCGVB(m) provides a convenient shortcut for a special multiple-VB structure calculation that a user don't have to write all linear independent spin configurations explicitly. The keywords SC(m) and SCVB(m) can also be used. SCGVB is limited to 12 electrons. It seems that the changing of array bounds to have more structures is a long way short of what is needed. SCGVB(13) and SCGVB(14) have the same number of structures but the time and resources to complete that calculation makes it totally unattainable at present.\n",
      "6.2.1 Method, 64, -1, 6.2.1 Method, SCGVB(m,n): We can ask ourselves: what would be the most natural way to extend Spin-Coupled method to systems where the number of electrons is not equal to the number of orbitals? In VB2000, we define it as the all spin-coupled states from all possible electron-orbital configurations which have the maximum number of occupied orbitals. For instance, in the case of SC(m,m), there only one such a configuration, that is all orbitals are occupied with one electron on each, and all spin-coupled states are from the spin-coupling schemes from this configuration. Thus SCGVB(m,m) = SCGVB(m). An essential advantage of SCGVB method is that the wave function and optimized orbitals are independent of the way to choose the Lewis structures of the SCGVB space, therefore, the results is not biased to any personal preference. As with SCGVB(m), the largest value of m is 12 but SCGVB(12,11) takes longer to run that SCGVB(12,12), One can make special use of SCGVB(m,n) when m = 2n, i.e. all orbitals are double-occupied. In this case, SCGVB option turns into non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock method. In VB2000, we use this trick to do non-orthogonal localized Hartree-Fock molecular orbital calculations. Even though for regular VB calculation the maximum number of electrons in each VB group is currently limited to 16, the non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock MO calculations does not have such a limitation. The limitation for the number of non-orthogonal molecular orbitals comes from the limit of total number of basis functions which can be handled by the program and the computational time. It should be noted that the non orthogonal Hartree-Fock MO computation is much more expensive than the regular Hartree-Fock method. CASVB(m,n)\n",
