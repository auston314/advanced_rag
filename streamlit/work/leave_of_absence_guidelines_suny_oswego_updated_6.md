## Leave of Absence (LOA) Guidelines

**Supervisors should not email any specific medical information and it is not appropriate to copy multiple individuals on emails containing details about employee medical matters. Medical information is private and should not be shared with others.**

**Applies to:**  
Leave of absence for NYS Employees.

**Purpose:**  
To provide guidance for staff, supervisors, and SUNY Oswego leadership.

**Procedure:**  
Appropriate form(s) and/or supporting documents must be completed and submitted to the Human Resources Office in a timely manner before a leave of absence will be considered for approval. All documentation will be maintained in a confidential and private manner and will be shared only with personnel who have a need to know (includes legal obligation).

Leave of absences for NYS employees are based on medical certifications that are reviewed and approved/denied pursuant to applicable contractual requirements, New York State Department of Civil Service Time and Attendance Rules, SUNY Policies of the Board of Trustees, policies, New York State and Federal laws and regulations.

*Note: All NYS Employees, regardless of sex (or length of service), are entitled to leave without pay for childcare for up to seven months following the date of delivery or adoption placement. For purposes of computing the seven-month period of mandatory leave, periods during which the employee was absent for “disability” or use of leave credits are included; the mandatory seven-month period is not extended by the granting of disability leave or the use of accrued leave. During a period of leave for childcare, employees shall be permitted, upon request, to use annual leave, personal leave, and overtime credits before being granted leave without pay.

There does not need to be a serious health condition or medical necessity for the absence; therefore, childcare during this time would be an allowable reason to take FMLA leave. However, the FMLA stipulates that intermittent leave is only available for the care of a healthy new child with the employer's agreement.<br>**Under PPL:** Employees should inform their manager of their intent to take PPL and coordinate with the HR Office to use/scheduling of their applicable leave entitlements prior to their leave beginning. |

## Medical Certification (CHCP for FMLA) and Recertification Requirements

The Human Resources Office may request a new CHCP form, or “recertification,” every six months when the duration of an ongoing serious medical condition (e.g., chronic, permanent, long-term condition) is described as "lifetime," “indefinite,” "permanent," etc. Generally, an employee may not be required to provide recertification more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an absence when no minimum duration for the condition is specified.

The HR Office may request a recertification when the original circumstances under which leave was granted have changed or the employer has reason to doubt that the absence is Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) qualifying. Additionally, recertification is required if the duration of the approved absence due to an employee’s medical leave goes beyond or ends prior to the specific or designated end date as per the previous medical certification.

When returning from a LOA for a personal medical condition (including on-the-job injury/illness), an employee may be required to submit a CHCP form completed by his/her health care provider that certifies his/her ability to safely return to work or fitness for duty. If limitations are required by an employee’s health care provider, they must be reviewed by department management and the HR Office prior to the employee’s return to work to determine if reasonable accommodations can be provided on a temporary or long-term basis and/or if a return-to-work medical exam is required.

## Employee Notice Requirements

When an employee has a foreseeable or unforeseeable absence due to an FMLA and/or PFL related reason, the employee must specifically reference the following and comply with normal and customary departmental time off request:

- the qualifying reason for leave (i.e., illness due to personal or family medical condition/serious illness);
- if FMLA leave for themselves or a qualifying family member (and/or PFL) (and if so, who the family member is-i.e., spouse);
- the expected duration of leave (i.e., approx. 2 weeks).

An employee needing FMLA and/or PFL leave (continuous or intermittent) must follow the employer's usual and customary call-in procedures for reporting an absence and absent unusual circumstances justifying the failure to comply; FMLA and/or PFL-protected leave may be delayed or denied, and the employee’s leave may be deemed unauthorized (unpaid) due to non-compliance.

## Reasons for Requiring Medical Certification

Medical certification or documentation completed by a recognized health care provider may be required for the following reasons:

- Due to a continuous (i.e., more than 3 consecutive calendar days, combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment) OR intermittent leave for a personal serious health condition (i.e., an overnight stay in a medical care facility) OR to care for a seriously ill eligible family member per the FMLA and/or PFL;
- Due to incapacity related to pregnancy;
- Due to an absence of more than four (4) consecutive workdays due to a personal employee disability (per CSEA Labor Agreements).
- When returning from a leave of absence for a personal medical condition (including hospitalization);
- Other absences which require an employee’s leave to be substantiated in consultation with the Human Resources Office.

## Accident Reporting/Workers' Compensation

If you have suffered a workplace injury or illness, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Workers’ compensation benefits provide protection for employees relative to medical expenses and loss of salary resulting from an occupational injury or illness. Basic protection is provided under the Workers' Compensation Law. If you have any questions, please contact Human Resources at 315-312-2230.

### What to do if you sustained a work-related injury or illness?

For New York State government employees of the State University of New York at Oswego:

1. You must complete an Employee Work Related Injury & Illness Report online at: [https://forms.gle/zccvPTSJHrDr2kus6](https://forms.gle/zccvPTSJHrDr2kus6).
2. You will receive a copy of the report in your email, please forward this to your supervisor.
3. Call the ARS (Accident Reporting System) toll-free number, 1-888-800-0029, within 24 hours of incident or as soon as possible thereafter. ARS will record your injury or illness quickly and confidentially. Write down the incident number the ARS Call Center gives you. *Your call to ARS helps ensure all workers’ compensation benefits are available to you as soon as possible. Depending on the nature of your injury or illness, benefits may include medical treatment, wage replacements, leave usage and other benefits. You will not have to pay out-of-pocket costs for medication.
4. Get medical treatment if you need it. Tell your doctor that your injury or illness is work-related.
5. If you begin to lose time from work or have sought treatment, notify HR at hr@oswego.edu immediately. You will need to provide documentation stating the days you missed work and the physician’s name, address, phone number.
6. If you are on a workers' compensation leave of absence, please review the below:
   - Employee must submit a return-to-work slip from their attending physician to Human Resources prior to returning to work. (Do not give any medical documentation to your supervisor.)
   - Human Resource will review the return-to-work slip and provide the employee with a return to work memorandum notifying the employee’s supervisor of the employee’s ability to return to work. Supervisors may not allow an employee to return to work unless he/she possesses the return-to-work memorandum from Human Resource.
   - If the return to work slip from the employee’s attending physician states there are limitations/restrictions on the employee’s ability to return to full duty, the attending physician must specify the limitations/restrictions and the duration for each (e.g., standing, bending, lifting, pulling, pushing, repetitive motion, frequency). If the documentation from the attending physician is not clear, Human Resource will ask the employee to obtain clarification from their attending physician.
   - Human Resources will review the limitations/restrictions with the employee’s supervisor to determine whether it is possible to temporarily modify job duties to comply with the limitations/restrictions. Approval for return with limitations/restrictions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and determination will be communicated to the employee by letter.
   - If the employee returned to work with limitations/restrictions, the employee must provide follow up medical documentation from their attending physician once the limitation/restriction duration period has ended, stating the employee is now able to perform the full duties of their position.
