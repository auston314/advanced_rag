Medical students

### III. POLICY AND PROCEDURE STATEMENT

Leaves of absence (LOA) are defined as a temporary separation from the University. In general, leaves of absences are granted for a maximum of one year. Under some circumstances, a leave of absence may be renewed upon re-application and provision of justification.

Students returning from leaves of absence must be approved by the Student Promotions Committee (SPC), as described below. The only exception is for students taking a leave for research.

Students who are on a leave of absence will not be enrolled in any coursework. They must surrender their hospital ID Badge(s), and Wildcard and will not have access to CTA UPass/Ventra card, NU student parking or student loans. Students who are on an approved leave of absence are permitted to remain enrolled in NU-Student Health Insurance Plan for the year in which they start on a leave. Once approved, students will receive a letter from the Registrar approving the leave and outlining all details of the leave. Feinberg is required to report all leaves/interruption of medical education in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). This is a brief 1-2 sentence description indicating the general reason for the leave.

#### Requesting a Leave of Absence

A written request to take a leave for reasons of personal or family emergency must be submitted to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. It must explain the nature of the situation for example death, disability, or serious illness of a family member. The request must also explain how the student expects to cope with his or her particular situation before returning, and the anticipated return date.

If a leave is being requested for health reasons, a written request to take a leave must be submitted to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In some cases, documentation from the treating physician supporting the leave may be required. The student and their physician should also provide an anticipated return date if possible.

All leaves of absence must be approved by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education.

#### Requesting a return to active status/end of Leave of Absence

All students are required to meet with the SPC before returning to active status, except for those who took a leave to conduct research. In certain circumstances, the SPC may require that a fitness for duty examination be performed on the student by appropriate professionals before reentry to Feinberg is granted. The committee may also ask how the student spent their leave of absence and how they have addressed their personal or academic issues in order to determine if a return to active status is in the best interest of the student at that time. Students are informed of the SPC decisions immediately after the committee meets. Additionally, formal notification of the SPC decision is sent in writing within 14 days after the meeting. In rare occasions, the SPC may decide that it is not in the best interest of the student or the patient care environment for the student to return to coursework at Feinberg and may extend the LOA. The student has the right to appeal the SPC decision.

Notice of students going on LOA will be provided to the University Registrar, Office of Student Accounts, and the Chicago Office of Financial Aid by the Feinberg School of Medicine Registrar.
