Covered employees may make a request to their supervisor and/or Human Resources Officer (“HRO”)/HR Business Partner for an unpaid personal leave of absence of up to three months.

#### Approval Process
Such leave requires the approval of the covered employee’s supervisor who, as part of the decision-making process, may consider such factors as previous requests for personal leave, the continuity of business operations, and the impact on the department. The supervisor should make his or her decision in consultation with the appropriate HRO/HR Business Partner.
