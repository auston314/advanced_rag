# Open-RAG

Open Architecture for Advanced GenAI based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

In this repo, we explore an open architecture that can maximize the efficiency and accuracy of RAG base Q&A. Our first principle for efficiency is the simplicity. We want to achieve high accuracy via creative algorithms while maintain the simplicity.
